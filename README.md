# Minesweeper
Small minesweeper game written in rust for a university project.

I used the druid library for the GUI.

To play the game, clone the project into a local directory. From console navigate to the cloned directory and give the following command:

cargo run --release

Choose your dificulty and play!

The first click on a cell flags it, the second one reveals it.

#### [AI Tool]
I used Github Copilot in VSCode for general vscode assitance.
I used ChatGPT for specific coding problems and also for suggesting a good rust GUI library.
